## Steps

This release pipeline is under continous improvement. If you encounter any problem, please refer to the [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section of this document. If the troubleshooting section does not contain the answer to the problem you encountered, please create an issue to improve either the pipeline (if the problem is a bug), or this document (if the problem is caused by human error).

- [ ] Check [default versions](#verify-default-hardcoded-versions) of images (see below).
- [ ] Check the `CHANGELOG.md` and update it with the new version number. Make sure the log is up to date.
- [ ] Check the Kong incubator [website][kongincubator] and update it with the released documentation.
- [ ] Check the existing [releases][releases] and determine the next version number.
- [ ] From [GitHub release action][release-action], start a new workflow run with the `release` input set to the release tag (e.g. `v0.1.0`).
- [ ] Wait for the workflow to complete.
- [ ] Submit the operator to [external hubs](#submit-to-external-hubs) (see below).
- [ ] The CI should create a PR in the Gateway Operator repo that syncs the release branch to the `main` branch. Merge it.
- [ ] After the PR is merged, a new release should be created automatically. Check the [releases][releases] page.

## Verify default hardcoded versions

The package [internal/consts][consts-pkg] contains a list of default versions for the operator. These versions should be updated to match the new release. The example consts to look for:

- `DefaultDataPlaneTag`
- `DefaultControlPlaneTag`
- `WebhookCertificateConfigBaseImage`

Also, the Makefile contains hardcoded information that needs to be updated:

- `CHANNELS` - the channels the operator is available on the OpenShift Operator Hub. For the technical preview we're using `alpha` channels. Please refer to the [OLM docs][olm-channels] for more information.
- `OPENSHIFT_SUPPORTED_VERSIONS` - the supported versions of OpenShift.

The Redhat Certified Operators bundles has a env vars file that needs to be updated `config/redhat-certified/manager_config_patch.yaml`:

- `RELATED_IMAGE_KONG` - the Kong data plane image.
- `RELATED_IMAGE_KONG_CONTROLLER` - the Kong control plane image.
- `RELATED_IMAGE_CERTIFICATE_CONFIG` - the image used to generate the webhook certificates.

## Submit to external hubs

- [ ] Submit the operator to the [OperatorHub](#operatorhub-community-operators-steps) and wait for it to be published (follow instruction below).
- [ ] Submit the operator to the Red Hat [Certified Operators](#red-hat-certified-operators-steps) and wait for it to be published (follow instruction below).

### OperatorHub Community Operators steps

[Operator Hub Community Operators][operator-hub-community]

- [ ] The PR to the [community operators][operator-hub-community] repository should be created by the CI. Please check that the PR exists in the [community operators][operator-hub-community] repository.

### Red Hat Certified Operators Steps

Please refer to the [Operator Certification Guide][operator-certification-pipeline] for more information.

- [ ] The CI should create a new branch in [the redhat certified operators repository fork][certified-operators-fork] named `kong-gateway-operator-<version>`.
- [ ] Verify that the [the redhat certified operators repository fork][certified-operators-fork] has the new branch and generated bundle is present in subdirectory `operators/kong-gateway-operator/<version>`. The CI should create a PR on the upstream repository; check it out.
- [ ] Start a tekton pipeline on the OpenShift cluster to test the operator, to do so, use the following procedure:

  1. Use the kubeconfig you find in [1Password][openshift-kubeconfig]

  1. Create a `workspace-template.yaml` file as follows:

      ```bash
      cat >> workspace-template.yaml << EOF
      spec:
        accessModes:
          - ReadWriteOnce
        resources:
          requests:
            storage: 5Gi
      EOF
      ```

  1. launch the tekton pipeline:
  
      ```console
      VERSION=<version> # e.g. v0.1.0
      BRANCH=kong-gateway-operator-$VERSION

      tkn pipeline start -n certified-operator-pipeline operator-ci-pipeline \
        --use-param-defaults \
        --param git_repo_url=git@github.com:Kong/redhat-certified-operators.git \
        --param git_branch=$BRANCH \
        --param bundle_path=operators/kong-gateway-operator/$VERSION \
        --param env=prod \
        --param upstream_repo_name=redhat-openshift-ecosystem/certified-operators \
        --param git_username=team-k8s-bot \
        --param git_email="team-k8s+github-bot@konghq.com" \
        --param pin_digests=true \
        --workspace name=ssh-dir,secret=github-ssh-credentials \
        --workspace name=pipeline,volumeClaimTemplateFile=templates/workspace-template.yml \
        --workspace name=registry-credentials,secret=registry-redhat-dockerconfig-secret \
        --param submit=true
      ```

## Troubleshooting

### The release needs to be started again with the same tag

If the release workflow needs to be started again with the same input version, the release branch needs to be deleted. The release branch is created by the CI and it's named `release/v<version>`. For example, if the release version is `v0.1.0`, the release branch will be `release/v0.1.0`.

It's only safe to start a release workflow with the version that was previously used if:

- The release PR to the gateway-operator repo is not merged yet.
- The external hub PRs are not merged yet.
- The tag that matches the release version does not exist.

Otherwise, if the above conditions are not meet, the release cannot be restarted. A new release needs to be started with an input version that would be next in semantic versioning.

Steps:

1. Delete the `release/v<version>` branch.
2. Delete the PR created by a release workflow.
3. Update the repository with the correct changes.
4. Start a new release workflow run.

### OperatorHub Community Operators PR failed

When the release workflow is restarted with the same input version, the OperatorHub Community Operators PR might fail. This is because the PR already exists in the [community operators][operator-hub-community] repository. The PR needs to be closed manually.

#### Option 1: Manually fix the the PR

Steps:

1. Checkout the [community operators fork][certified-operators-fork] repository.
2. Checkout the branch named `kong-gateway-operator-<version>`.
3. Fix the PR.
4. Commit the changes. The commits need to have a `signed-off-by` clause. (`git commit -s`)
5. Push the changes to the [community operators fork][certified-operators-fork].

#### Option 2: Re-run the workflow

It's only safe to do so if:

- The release PR to the gateway-operator repo is not merged yet.
- The external hub PRs are not merged yet.
- The tag that matches the release version does not exist.

Otherwise, if the above condition are not meet, the release cannot be restarted. Instead, use the [Option 1](#option-1-manually-fix-the-the-pr).

Steps:

1. Login to GitHub as `team-k8s-bot`
2. Delete the PR together with the branch from the [community operators fork][certified-operators-fork] repository.
3. Delete the release from the [releases][releases] page.
4. Start a new release workflow run.

### The Tekton pipeline failed because of the Pyxis token invalidity

In the past happened that the Tekton pipeline failed because the Pyxis token was invalid. If this situation represents, it is necessary to create a new Pyxis token in the Red Hat connect portal by following these [instructions][pyxis-token-creation] and update the Kubernetes secret by following these [instructions][pyxis-kubernetes-secret-creation].
